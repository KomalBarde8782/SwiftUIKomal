//ðŸ”¹ @StateObject â€“ Owner and Creator
//Used when the current view creates and owns the observable object.
//
//SwiftUI manages the lifecycle of the object.
//
//The object is created once during the viewâ€™s lifecycle, even if the view is recreated.
//
//âœ… Use when:
//You're initializing the observable object inside the view.
                                                                    
class Counter: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0
}

struct MyView: View {
    @StateObject var counter = Counter() // Creates and owns the instance

    var body: some View {
        Text("Count: \(counter.count)")
        Button("Increment") {
            counter.count += 1
        }
